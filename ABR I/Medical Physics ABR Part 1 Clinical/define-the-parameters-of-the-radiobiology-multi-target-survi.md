## BackText
n = exp (Dq/D0)
D0[Gy] (reciprocal of final slope): Dose requried to reduce the survival at the right part of the curve. ***
D1[Gy] (reciprocal of initial slope): Dose required to reduce the survival at the left part of the curve. ***
n[1] (extrapolation #): width of the shoulder; Small => radiosensitive. 
Dq[Gy] (quasi threshold dose): Dose below which there is "minimal or no effect".
*** These are reduced to 0.37 ( 1/e ) of initial value.
