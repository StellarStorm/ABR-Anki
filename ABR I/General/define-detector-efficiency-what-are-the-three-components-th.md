## Question
<h2>Define detector efficiency. What are the three components that affect it?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>\(\epsilon = \frac{\text{Counts recorded}}{\text{Number of emitted particles}}\)</p>
<p>Detector efficiency is affected by
1. Intrinsic efficiency: how many of the incident particles to the detector are actually recorded, \(\epsilon_{\text{intrinsic}} = \frac{\text{Counts recorded}}{\text{Number of incident particles}}\)
2. Geometric efficiency: how much of the radiation actually reaches the detector, \(\epsilon_{\text{geometric}} = \frac{\Omega}{4\pi}\) 
3. Dead time: the minimum time between counts for subsequent events to be detected separately.</p>
