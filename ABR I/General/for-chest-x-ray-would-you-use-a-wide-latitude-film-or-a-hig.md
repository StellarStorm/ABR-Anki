## Question
<h2>For chest x-ray, would you use a wide-latitude film or a high-contrast film? What about for mammography?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>For chest x-ray, use a wide-latitude film because there’s a large difference in attenuation (soft tissue, lungs, bone)</p>
<p>For mammography, use a high-contrast film because the attenuation is all similar.</p>
<p>(recall: latitude relates the range of air kerma values to create an acceptable image contrast. It’s inversely related to film gradient which provides contrast)</p>
