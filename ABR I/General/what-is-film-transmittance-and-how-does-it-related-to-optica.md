## Question
<h2>What is film transmittance and how does it related to optical density?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Film transmittance is the fraction of incident light passing through the film, \(T=\frac{I_t}{I_0}\).</p>
<p>Since optical density is \(OD=\log{\frac{I_0}{I_t}}\), it could also be expressed as \(OD=\log{\frac{1}{T}}\)</p>
