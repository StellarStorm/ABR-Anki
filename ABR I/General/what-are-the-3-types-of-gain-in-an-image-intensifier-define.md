## Question
<h2>What are the 3 types of gain in an image intensifier? Define each & give formulas.</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>Minification gain: the increase in image brightness that results from reduction in image size from the input phosphor to the output phosphor \(D = (\frac{d_i}{d_o})^2\) where \(d_i\) is the input diameter and \(d_o\) is the output diameter.</li>
<li>Flux gain is the number of light photons emitted from the output phosphor relative to the number of light photons produced in the input phosphor. It’s typically 50.</li>
<li>Brightness gain is the increase in brightness at the output phosphor relative to the brightness at the input phosphor. It’s the product of minification gain and flux gain </li>
</ol>
<p>Example problem:
If the output phosphor is 2.5cm in diameter and the input phosphor is 25cm in diameter:
\(D = (\frac{25}{2.5})^2 = 100\)
Flux gain ~50
\(BG = 100 \times 50 = 5,000\) as the overall brightness gain of the image intensifier</p>
