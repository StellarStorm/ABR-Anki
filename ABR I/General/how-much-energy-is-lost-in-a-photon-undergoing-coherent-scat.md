## Question
<h2>How much energy is lost in a photon undergoing coherent scatter? What effect does coherent scatter have on imaging?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Photons lose no energy in coherent scatter, just change direction. Scattered photons will degrade image quality if they reach the image receptor.</p>
