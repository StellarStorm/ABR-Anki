## Question
<h2>How do bone inhomogeneities affect the treatment beam and dose?</h2><div><ul>
<li><p>Beam attenuation</p></li>
<li><p>Dose to bone vs. soft tissue</p></li>
<li><p>Soft tissue</p></li></ul></div>

## Answer
<section>
<ul><li><p>Since bone is denser than soft tissue, the beam attenuation increases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recall that Compton scatter is approximately independent of tissue type in the body. So at 6MV, dose to bone will be approximately the same as to any other soft tissue. However, at higher energies pair production starts to become important and means that bone receives more dose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soft tissue just distal to bone has higher dose from backscattered electrons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
