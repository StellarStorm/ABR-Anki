## Question
<h2>Describe the components of the primary barrier shielding formula \(B = \frac{P d^2}{WUT}\)</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p></p><ul><li>B: transmission factor, the maximum allowable transmission which will allow the barrier to achieve its shielding design goals (P)</li><li>P: the weekly dose limit</li><li>d: the distance to the point of measurement (remember, for a wall this is 0.3m <strong>away</strong> from the wall)</li><li>W: Workload of the linac in Gy/wk</li><li>U: User factor, the fraction of time the beam is pointed at the barrier</li><li>T: Occupancy factor, the fraction of workweek the space behind the barrier is occupied</li></ul><p></p>
