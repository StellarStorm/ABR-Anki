## Question
<h2>What are the coils/magnets of an MR system?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>Main coil: produces the main magnetic field \(B_0\)</li>
<li>Shim coils: reduce inhomogeneities in the magnetic field</li>
<li>RF coils: Transmit flip signals and receive signals/echos from the patient</li>
<li>Gradient coils: Alter the Larmor frequency and phase in 3D space to localize the received signals.</li>
</ol>
