## Question
<h2>For TBI the spoiler is placed close to the patient, but for TSET the scatterer is placed close to the linac exit window. Why the difference?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>The spoiler is there to produce Compton electrons and increase superficial dose. We’d want it close to the patient’s skin so the electrons don’t get attenuated or scattered away.</p>
<p>The scatterer is there to make the electron beam more uniform across the patient’s skin. Placing it close to the exit window means the electrons interacting with it will be higher energy so a narrower scatter angle and a deeper depth-dose curve will be generated. Placing the scatterer close to the patient’s skin would mean the electrons are lower energy by this point (remember CSDA!) and could therefore be scattered at wider angles.</p>
