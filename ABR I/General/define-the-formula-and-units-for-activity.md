## Front
Define the formula and units for activity

## Back
Activity is the rate of radioactive decay measured as disintegrations per unit time
\[A = \frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t}\]It's measured in <i>becquerels</i> or <i>Curies</i> 
<ol><li>\(1 \text{Bq} = 1 \text{dps}\)
</li><li>\(1 \text{Ci} = 3.7 \times 10^{10} \text{dps}\)</li></ol><div><i>"dps"</i> = disentegrations per second - so this could also be expressed as </div>\(s^{-1}\) which will be helpful to remember for unit analysis.<div>One Curie is about the activity of 1 gram of Ra-226.
