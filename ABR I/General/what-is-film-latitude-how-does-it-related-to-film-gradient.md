## Question
<h2>What is film latitude? How does it related to film gradient?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Film latitude is the range of air kerma values that result in a satisfactory image contrast.</p>
<p>Latitude and gradient are inversely related. The higher the film gradient, the narrower the range of air kerma values that result in good image contrast.</p>
