## Front
Describe the photoelectric effect

## Back
<ol><li>A photon is completely absorbed by an electron (typically inner-shell), which is ejected from the atom. The energy of the electron is the difference between photon energy and shell binding energy, \(E_{e^-} = h\nu - E_b\)</li><ul><li>This implies the photon energy <u>must be equal or greater</u> than the binding energy of the orbital electron</li></ul><li>The probability of a photoelectric absorption is \(\propto \frac{Z^3}{E^3}\)
</li><li>The <u>resonance effect</u> is that the likelihood of a PE interaction greatly increases for photons with energy close to the binding energy of the electron
