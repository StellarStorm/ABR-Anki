## Question
<h2>What is the threshold energy for pair production? At what beam energy do we start to consider it?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Pair production requires the photon to have at least 1.022 MeV energy. However we donâ€™t consider it in therapy until around a 10MV beam energy.</p><p>The special case of triplet production (an electron is the triggering particle, instead of a photon) requires 2.044 MeV.</p><p><img src="paste-253a2cc4af043496ef0adf290fa09844f701373c.png">
