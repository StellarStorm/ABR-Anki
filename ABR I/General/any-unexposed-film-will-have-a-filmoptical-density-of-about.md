## Question
<h2>Any unexposed film will have a film/optical density of about 0.2. What is this from (2)?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>There is some intrinsic optical density from two sources, base and fog, that gives OD~0.2.</p>
<p>Base is the density of the film base alone, which will absorb some fraction of the incident light.
Fog is the level of film blackening from a few grains being developed even without exposure to radiation.
B+F=~0.2 OD levels. </p>
