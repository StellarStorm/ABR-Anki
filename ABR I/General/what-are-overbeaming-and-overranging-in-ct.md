## Question
<h2>What are overbeaming and overranging in CT?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Overbeaming refers to the penumbra of the CT beam along the axial direction, which does not contribute to the image and so gives additional dose to the patient. It is more pronounced for narrower beams, as these have a relatively larger penumbra and have to make many more rotations to cover a given distance in the z-direction.</p>
<p>Overranging refers to the required extra rotations outside the scan range so a spiral scan can be properly reconstructed. This is typically 1-4 additional rotations on each end. It is more pronounced for wider beams, as they will give more overall dose per rotation. </p>
