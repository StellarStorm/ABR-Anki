Describe \(\beta^+\)decay

## Back
\(\ce{X^A_Z \rightarrow Y^A_{Z-1} + \beta^+ + \nu + Q}\)

<i>To remember which </i>\(\beta\)<i> decay mechanism releases an anti-neutrino and which releases a neutrino, I like to remember that each releases one "normal" particle and one anti-particle. A positron is an anti-electron, so </i>\(\beta^+\)<i> decay must release a neutrino. An electron is "normal" so </i>\(\beta^-\)<i> must release an anti-neutrino.</i>
