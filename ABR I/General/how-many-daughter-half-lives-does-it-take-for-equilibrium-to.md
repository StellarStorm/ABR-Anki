## Question
<h2>How many daughter half-lives does it take for equilibrium to occur? What is the basic meaning of radioactive equilibrium?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>It takes approximately 4 daughter half-lives to reach equilibrium. This is true for both secular and transient equilibrium.</p>
<p>Radioactive equilibrium occurs when the ratios between activities remains constant. (https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/R05084)</p>
