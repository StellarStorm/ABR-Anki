## Question
<h2>How does CT pitch affect dose to the patient?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>When pitch < 1, the patient gets more dose due to overlap.</p>
<p>When pitch > 1, the patient receives rather less dose.</p>
<p>Recall that \(\text{pitch} = \frac{\text{Table movement per rotation}}{\text{slice thickness}}\)</p>
