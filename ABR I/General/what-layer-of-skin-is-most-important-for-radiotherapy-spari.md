## Question
<h2>What layer of skin is most important for radiotherapy (sparing)? How deep is it, and what reference depth do we use?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>The basal layer is the most important, because there are lots of rapidly dividing cells here that are especially radiosensitive.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s about 0.05-0.4mm deep, and we use 0.1mm as the reference depth</p>
