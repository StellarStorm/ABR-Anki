## Question
<h2>Equivalent Squares</h2>
<ul>
<li>How to then correct for MLC blocking, if any?</li>
</ul>

## Answer
<section>
<p>The equivalent square formula is \(S = \frac{4A}{P}\)</p>
<p>Example: For a \(2 \times 9\)cm field, the equivalent square is \(S=\frac{4\cdot18}{22}=3.3\)cm.</p>
<p>A simple method to estimate the equivalent square field of a blocked field is to then correct by \(FS_{eq, blocked} = FS_{eq, unblocked} \cdot \sqrt{1 - f}\) where \(f\) is the fraction of the field that is blocked.</p>
