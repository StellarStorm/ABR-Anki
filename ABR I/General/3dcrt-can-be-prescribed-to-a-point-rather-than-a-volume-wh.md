## Question
<h2>3DCRT can be prescribed to a point, rather than a volume. Why?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>3D dose distributions around the target are relatively uniform - if you know dose to a point, you pretty much know dose everywhere around the tumor.</p>
<p>It is important to use a point where dose can be calculated accurately (e.g, no buildup regions, near steep gradients, or at tissue interfaces) and in a central part of the PTV (usually isocenter or within beam intersection).</p>
