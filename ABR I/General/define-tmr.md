## Question
<h2>Define TMR</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ul>
<li>Idea</li>
<li>Equation</li>
</ul>
<p>Tissue-maximum ratio (TMR) is the ratio of dose at some depth to dose at \(d_{max}\). This means it is a <strong>relative</strong> metric. It’s found by taking measurements of dose at a <u>​fixed isocenter</u> and changing the depth, e.g., in a water tank by adding more water, <strong>never by moving the measurement isocenter</strong>.</p>
<p>\(TMR(d) = \frac{D(d)}{D(d_{max})}\)</p>
