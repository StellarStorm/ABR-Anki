## Question
<h2>What are typical targets in mammo (2)? Why do we use them instead of tungsten?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>We tend to use Mo (K-edge 20.0keV) or Rh (K-edge 23.2keV). This is because there is little difference in attenuation between normal tissue and tumor in the breast, and the greatest separation is at low energies. Since these metals have low K-edges, we can use their characteristic X-rays for imaging. </p>
