## Question
<h2>What type of artifact is this? What causes it, and how can we address it?</h2><div><img alt="" src="55CB1C1D-363F-4796-BE84-C755658FFA3B.png"> <img alt="" src="39339BF9-FD56-4D2B-AE1A-28DF0913AA7E.png">

## Answer
<section>
<p>This is a helical or windmill artifact. It occurs at high subject contrast interfaces (e.g. bone and soft tissue, air and soft tissue, IV contrast in tubing) and varies with pitch. We can address by reducing pitch or using thinner slices.
