## Question
<h2>How do daily and monthly QA tests differ?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Monthly dosimetry QA test adds a beam quality check (tolerance 1%) to the daily dosimetry tests (output and profile).</p>
<p>Daily mechanical QA is mostly just field size, laser, and ODI. Monthly tests almost everything (isocentricity, treatment couch positions, light-radiation field coincidence).</p>
