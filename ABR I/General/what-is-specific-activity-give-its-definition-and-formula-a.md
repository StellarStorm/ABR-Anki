## Question
<h2>What is specific activity? Give its definition and formula and describe why it’s useful.</h2>

<p>Specific activity is the activity per unit mass. It’s helpful because it indicates how “concentrated” a particular radioisotope is (how much activity for a given mass).</p>
<p>\(a = \lambda \frac{N_A}{A}\)</p>
