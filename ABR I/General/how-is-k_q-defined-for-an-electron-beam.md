## Question
<h2>How is \(k_Q\) defined for an electron beam?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>\(k_Q = P^Q_{gr} \cdot k^\prime_{R_{50}} \cdot k_{ecal}\) where</p>
<ul>
<li>\(P^Q_{gr}\) is the gradient correction factor that depends on the ionization gradient at the point of measurement.</li>
<li>\(k^\prime_{R_{50}}\) is the electron quality conversion factor that converts \(N^{Q_{ecal}}_{D, w}\)<em> into \(N^Q_{D,w}\)</em> for any beam quality Q.</li>
<li>\(k_{ecal}\) is the photon-electron conversion factor, that converts \(N^{^{60}Co}_{D, w}\)<em> into \(N^{Q_{ecal}}_{D,w}\)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that conceptually, \(k_{ecal}\) should come first to convert from a photon beam into an electron beam of quality \(Q_{ecal}\), and then \(k^\prime_{R_{50}}\)  would be applied to convert into any electron beam quality Q</em></p>
