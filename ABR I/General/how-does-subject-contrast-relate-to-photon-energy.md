## Question
<h2>How does subject contrast relate to photon energy?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Subject contrast is inversely related to photon energy. Lower-energy photons produce higher-contrast images because more photons are likely to be attenuated differently from the PE effect.</p>
<p>(Related to why MV images are so poor contrast)</p>
