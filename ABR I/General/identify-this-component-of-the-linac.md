## Remarks
Accelerating Waveguide: A series of microwave resonance cavities used to accelerate the electron beam to high energies.

Bending Magnet: The bending magnet  is a magnetic lens used to focus and position the beam to intercept the target (for photon treatments) or scattering foil (for electron treatments). The angle of bending varies by manufacturer but may be either 90°, 112.5°, or 270°. Magnetic focus attempts to be achromatic (does not separate by energy at point of focus).

Circulator: A device in the waveguide that is used to prevent microwave energy from reflecting backwards to the Klystron/Magnetron.

Cooling System: Production of a clinical treatment beam is an energy inefficient process due to losses in microwave generation and acceleration. A water or air cooling system is required to maintain a stable operation temperature necessary for consistent beam energy production.

Electron Gun: An electron gun produces the electrons which are accelerated in the accelerating waveguide. Electron guns consist of a heated filament (~800°C – 1100°C) which “boils off” a cloud of electrons. These electrons are immediately accelerated by a low E field (~40kV).​ Electron guns may be either of the diode or triode types. Diode electron guns consist simply of the heated cathode and an anode which set the accelerating voltage. Triode electron guns add a control grid between the cathode and anode which serves to recollect a portion of the liberated electrons. Thus, the triode design allows for variable beam current by preventing a variable fraction of electrons from reaching the accelerator.

Energy Selector: An energy selector may be placed within the bending magnet array to narrow the allowed electron energy range incident on the target/scattering foil. Typical energy band pass range in of the order of 6% (97%- 103% of desired energy).

Klystron/Magnetron: Klystrons and Magnetrons produce the microwave used to power the accelerating waveguide.

Treatment Head: The treatment head contains components required for beam production and shaping including targets, scattering foils, beam shaping collimators and the optical distance indicator.

Waveguide: The waveguide is a channel directing the microwave power from the Klystron/Magnetron to the Accelerating Waveguide. The waveguide is filled with an insulating gas (typically Sulfur Hexaflouride, SF6) to prevent electrical arcing. Microwave transparent ceramic barriers prevent the SF6 from leaking into the vacuum spaces filling the Klystron/Magnetron and the Accelerating Waveguide.
