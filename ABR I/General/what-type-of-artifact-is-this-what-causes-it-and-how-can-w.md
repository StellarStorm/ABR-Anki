## Question
<h2>What type of artifact is this? What causes it, and how can we address it?</h2><div><img alt="" src="3971CF5B-9414-4129-83B5-844B432187F6.png"> <img alt="" src="E67C62AC-F4BE-4139-9F6C-5B1D108CBC45.png">

## Answer
<section>
<p>This is <em>beam-hardening artifact</em>. It results as the effective energy of the beam is shifted higher as it passes through an object. The portions with a longer path length will exhibit lower attenuation due to higher effective E.
</p>
<p>We can address it with a higher kVp to harden the beam. </p>
