## Question
<h2>What is \(P_{elec}\), where does it come from, and what are the units?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>\(P_{elec}\) is the electrometer correction factor. It should be provided by the ADCL if the electrometer and the ion chamber were calibrated separately; if they were calibrated together then it is equal to 1.
[\(P_{elec}\)] = C/rdg or C/C.</p>
