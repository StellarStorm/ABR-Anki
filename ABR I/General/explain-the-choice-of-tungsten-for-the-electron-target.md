## Question
<h2>Explain the choice of tungsten for the electron target.</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>To produce x-rays efficiently, Brem. is the process we use. Recall that radiative stopping power \(S_{rad}\) is responsible for producing brem. But in most materials, radiative stopping power is much lower than collisional stopping power. The exception is for <u>​high-energy electrons in a high-Z material</u>. So we need a high-Z target.</p>
<p>As well, collisional stopping power \(S_{col}\) is still a major player. A significant byproduct is heat. Since we don’t want the target to melt down, we need a material with a high melting temperature.</p>
<p>Tungsten is high-Z (Z=74) and has the highest melting point of any element (3422C) so it is a good choice for our target.</p>
