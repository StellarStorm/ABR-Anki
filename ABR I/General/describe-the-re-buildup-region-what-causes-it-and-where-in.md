## Question
<h2>Describe the re-buildup region. What causes it, and where in the body might we observe its effects?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>The re-buildup region is where we get a second build-up region due to the beam entering soft tissue from a lower-density area. This could be found in the body as the beam passes through the lung and re-enters soft tissue.</p>
