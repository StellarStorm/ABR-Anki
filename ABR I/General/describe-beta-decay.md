## Front
Describe \(\beta^-\) decay

## Back
\(\ce{X^A_Z \rightarrow Y^A_{Z+1} + \beta^- + \hat{\nu} + Q}\)
<ul><li>Neutron converts into a proton, an electron, and an anti-neutrino</li><li>The only neutron-rich decay mechanism (radionuclides lie above the line of stability)</li><li><u>Continuous</u> energy spectrum as the energy gets shared between the electron and the anti-neutrino

<i>To remember which </i>\(\beta\)<i> decay mechanism releases an anti-neutrino and which releases a neutrino, I like to remember that each releases one "normal" particle and one anti-particle. A positron is an anti-electron, so </i>\(\beta^+\)<i> decay must release a neutrino. An electron is "normal" so </i>\(\beta^-\)<i> must release an anti-neutrino.</i>
