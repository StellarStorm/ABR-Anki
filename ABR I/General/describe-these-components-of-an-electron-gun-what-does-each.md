1. The <b>cathode</b> is heated to between 800-1100*C to “boil off” electrons.
2. The <b>grid</b> has voltage that is pulsed with the accelerating wave guide, so electrons only pass through at optimal moments for acceleration. Note that this is only for <i>triode-type</i> electron guns. <i>Diode-type</i> do not have a grid.
3. The <b>anode</b> is positively charged. Electrons pass through it into the accelerating waveguide.
