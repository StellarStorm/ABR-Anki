## Question
<h2>Why do we use intensifying screens instead of exposing film to x-rays directly?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Film isn’t very sensitive to x-rays (~1% absorption) so we’d have to deliver quite a bit of dose to get an image. Scintillating, intensifying screens release about hundreds of light photons for every x-ray photon absorbed, substantially improving efficiency. For a given film density, the exposure needed can be improved 30-50 times.</p>
