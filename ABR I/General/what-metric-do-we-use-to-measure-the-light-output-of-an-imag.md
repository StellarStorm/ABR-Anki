## Question
<h2>What metric do we use to measure the light output of an image intensifier? What are typical values?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>We use <strong>conversion factor</strong>, the ratio of luminance (\(cd/m^2\)) to air-kerma rate (mGy/s). Typical values are 10-30 \(cd/m^2 \text{per} \mu Gy/s\)</p>
