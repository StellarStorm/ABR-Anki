## Front
How many electron scattering foils are typically in a linac? Describe their materials, purposes, and approximate thicknesses.

## Back
There are generally two electron scattering foils.
<ol><li>The first is a high-Z material, typically tantalum or gold. This provides a lot of electron scatter for the collisional stopping power. The thickness of the first foil is about 0.05-0.4mm.</li><li>The second is a lower-Z material to remove Bremmstrahlung, typically aluminum. it is about 1-3mm thick.</li></ol>
