## Question
<h2>Photon contamination ??? with increasing electron beam energy</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Photon contamination will <u>â€‹increase</u> as electron beam energy increases</p>
<p>This makes sense - recall that \(S_{rad}\) increase with increasing electron energy (and material Z). For higher-energy electron therapy, we can expect more photon contamination and a higher x-ray tail in the PDD.</p>
