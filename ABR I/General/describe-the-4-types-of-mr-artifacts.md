## Question
<h2>Describe the 4 types of MR artifacts</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>Magnetic inhomogeneity artifacts (\(B_0\) field)</li>
<li>Magnetic susceptibility artifacts when thereâ€™s a metal artifact in or near the field. Usually looks like a signal void in the image.</li>
<li>Gradient distortions when the gradient is larger than expected. Will cause image to appear compressed in that direction.</li>
<li>Chemical shift artifacts at the interfaces of two very different materials. The precession frequency of protons will be slightly slower on one side due to the different chemical environments, resulting in a physical shift of the signal.</li>
</ol>
