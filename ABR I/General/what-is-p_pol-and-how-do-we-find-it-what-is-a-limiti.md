## Question
<h2>What is \(P_{pol}\), and how do we find it? What is a limiting factor?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>\(P_{pol}\) is the polarity correction factor. The effects of polarity on the reading depends on beam quality and factors such as cable position. We find it by measuring the ion chamber output at Â±300V, and then solving
\(P_{pol} = |\frac{M^+_{raw} - M^-_{raw}}{2 M_{raw}}|\)</p>
<p>The denominator \(M_{raw}\) can be either the positive or the negative reading at your discretion.</p>
<p>It is vital to use the signs of the readings!</p>
<p>If the polarity correction factor is not within 0.97-1.03, then you have to get a value for \(P_{pol}\) from the calibrating lab using their beam.</p>
