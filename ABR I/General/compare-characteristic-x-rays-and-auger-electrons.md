## Question
<h2>Compare characteristic x-rays and Auger electrons.</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Both occur after a higher-orbital electron falls into a “hole” in a lower-energy shell (e.g. after a lower-energy electron is ejected from the atom).</p>
<p>A characteristic x-ray occurs as the higher-energy electron releases the excess energy as it falls into the hole. Since shells are quantized, this photon can only be one of a few energies.</p>
<p>An Auger electron occurs as the excess energy is transferred to another electron, which is then ejected from the atom. Of course, this requires the excess energy to be greater than that of the binding energy of the ejected electron.</p>
