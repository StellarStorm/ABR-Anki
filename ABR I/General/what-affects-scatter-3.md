## Question
<h2>What affects scatter? (3)</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>Geometry of the imaging system - greater distance between object and detector = less scatter (but also increased magnification, and worse spatial resolution from the penumbra)</li>
<li>Patient geometry - thinner anatomical region = less scatter</li>
<li>Field size - larger field size = more scatter</li>
</ol>
