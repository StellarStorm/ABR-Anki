## Question
<h2>What beam parameters does TMR depend on? (2)</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>TMR depends on</p>
<ol>
<li>Beam energy. TMR falls off less quickly with depth as beam energy increases, due to reduced attenuation at higher energies and increase of \(d_{max}\).</li>
<li>Field size. TMR increases with field size due to scatter effects, like PDD.</li>
</ol>
