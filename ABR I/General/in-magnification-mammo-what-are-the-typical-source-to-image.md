## Question
<h2>In magnification mammo, what are the typical source-to-image receptor distance (SID) and source-to-object distance (SOD)? What magnification factor does this give?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>SOD is typically 35cm, and SID is typically 65cm. This gives a magnification factor of \(\frac{65cm}{35cm}=1.86\). </p>
