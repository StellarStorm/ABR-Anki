## Question
<h2>How does PDD differ from the model predicted by simple exponential fall-off? (2)</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>Over most of the curve, PDD > exponential falloff \(e^{-\mu x}\) because photons from the beam sides are scattered in towards the beam centerline, where PDD is measured.</li>
<li>At the beginning, the dose buildup effect/skin sparing means that PDD < exponential falloff because electrons are more likely to scatter forward following Compton interaction.</li>
</ol>
