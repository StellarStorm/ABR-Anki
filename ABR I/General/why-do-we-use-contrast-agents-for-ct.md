## Question
<h2>Why do we use contrast agents for CT?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>At CT energies, Compton scatter (mostly Z-independent) is predominant for soft tissue, even though thereâ€™s still a lot of Photoelectric to go around. The higher overall Z of iodine means that there will be relatively more photoelectric interactions, leading to a larger difference in mass attenuation coefficient and providing contrast. </p>
