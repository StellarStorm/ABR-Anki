## Question
<h2>At higher electron beam energies, what trend do we observe with isodose lines?</h2><div>What is the interpretation of this for beam penumbra?
</div>

## Answer
<section>
<p>High-dose isodose lines (e.g. 90%) constrict
Low-dose isodose lines (e.g. 20%) bulge out
</p>
<p>In other words,  the penumbra is less at shallow depths but much greater at deeper depths for a high-energy electron beam relative to a low-energy electron beam.</p>
