## Question
<h2>Why is attenuation correction important for PET-CT?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>The annihilation photons will be attenuated as they exit the patient. How much is attenuated depends on the anatomical region. For instance, the lungs won’t attenuate as much as soft tissue in the abdomen, so an uncorrected image would show relatively high activity in the lungs (even though there isn’t). Attenuation correction uses information from the CT to account for this.</p>
