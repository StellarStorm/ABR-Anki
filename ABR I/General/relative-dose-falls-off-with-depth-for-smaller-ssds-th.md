## Question
<h2>Relative dose falls off ????? with depth for smaller SSDs than larger SSDs. Why?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Relative dose falls off <u>â€‹more quickly</u> with depth for smaller SSDs than larger SSDs.</p>
<p>Recall that PDD includes inverse square falloff (as well as tissue attenuation and scatter). For a small SSD, the ISL will be a major contributor in relative dose falloff with increasing depth. For an extreme example, consider an SSD of 10cm. At depth in the patient of 10cm (so 20cm from source), ISL falloff should be along \((\frac{10cm}{20cm})^2 = 0.25\) the entrance intensity.</p>
<p>However, for a larger SSD, the ISL will no longer be a major contributor in relative dose falloff with increasing depth. Consider an SSD of 110cm. At the same 10cm depth in the patient (so 120cm from source), ISL falloff would only be along \((\frac{110cm}{120cm})^2=0.84\) the entrance intensity.</p>
<p>As tissue attenuation and scatter would be roughly the same for both SSDs, the difference in ISL effects are why relative dose falls off more quickly with depth for smaller SSDs than larger SSDs.</p>
