## Question
<h2>Describe Spencer-Attix cavity theory. What are the assumptions and the formula? Does it assume the cavity is large or small?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Spencer-Attix cavity theory assumes
1. CPE or TCPE is present
2. All electrons that cause ionizations in the cavity are created from the phantom material
3. The secondary electron spectum is unchanged by the presence of the cavity</p>
<p>\(\frac{D_{\text{med}}}{D_{\text{gas}}} = (\frac{\bar{L}}{\rho})^{\text{med}}_{\text{gas}}\)</p>
<p>Note that this is like Bragg-Gray cavity theory, but without assumption ##4 that implies a large cavity. As assumptions 2 and 3 imply a small cavity, S-A cavity theory implies a small cavity only.</p>
