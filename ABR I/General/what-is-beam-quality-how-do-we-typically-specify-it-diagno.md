## Question
<h2>What is beam quality? How do we typically specify it (diagnostic energies)?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Beam quality refers to the ability of the x-ray beam to penetrate the patient. We typically specify it as the thickness of aluminum required to reduce beam intensity by 50% (that is, the HVL).</p>
