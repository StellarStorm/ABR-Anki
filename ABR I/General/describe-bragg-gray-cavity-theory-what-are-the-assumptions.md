## Question
<h2>Describe Bragg-Gray cavity theory. What are the assumptions and the formula? Does it assume the cavity is large or small?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Bragg-Gray cavity theory assumes:
1. CPE or TCPE is present
2. All electrons causing ionizations in the cavity arise from the phantom material
3. The secondary electron spectrum is unchanged by the presence of the cavity
4. The energy of secondary electrons created are deposited locally</p>
<p>\(\frac{D_{\text{med}}}{D_{\text{gas}}} = (\frac{S}{\rho})^{\text{med}}_{\text{gas}}\)</p>
<p>Note that assumptions 2 and 3would imply a small cavity, while assumption 4 implies a large cavity, so both are assumed (we just live with this contradiction).</p>
