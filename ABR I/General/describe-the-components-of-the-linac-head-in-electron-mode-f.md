## Question
<h2>Describe the components of the linac head in electron mode from source to patient</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>Electrons exiting bending magnet</li>
<li>Primary collimator: conical in shape, restricts beam to a circular region</li>
<li>Scattering foil: low-Z, scatters beam to provide approximately flat fluence across face of the beam</li>
<li>Monitor chamber: ion chambers to monitor dose of beam passing through. Chamber 1 shuts off the beam after enough MUs during treatment, and chamber 2 serves as a backup.</li>
<li>Mirror assembly system: thin mylar window at 45 degrees to beam with light source to reflect off and down.</li>
<li>Jaws: thick metal collimators, <strong>pulled back</strong></li>
<li>MLCs: numerous metal blades, <strong>pulled back</strong></li>
<li>Electron cone holding Cerrobend block.</li>
</ol>
