## Question
<h2>What are practical methods of reducing scatter?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Air gaps between the patient and receptor reduce scatter because secondary photons are less likely to reach the receptor
  - However, this results in increased magnification and is not suitable for many applications because the receptor is too small to capture the area needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antiscatter grids between the patient and the receptor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
