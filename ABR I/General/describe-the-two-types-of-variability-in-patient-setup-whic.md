## Question
<h2>Describe the two types of variability in patient setup. Which one has larger impact, and why?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>Random errors, which are the day-to-day variabilities from the ideal positioning</li>
<li>Systematic errors, which are the overall offsets of the average positionings from the ideal positioning</li>
</ol>
<p>Since systematic error affects every treatment in the same direction, it has a larger impact than random error.</p>
