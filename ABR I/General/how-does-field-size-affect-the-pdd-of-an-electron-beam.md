## Question
<h2>How does field size affect the PDD of an <u>electron</u> beam?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Field size only becomes important when itâ€™s smaller than the practical range (recall \(R_p \approx \frac{E}{2}\)) because lateral equilibrium begins to get lost. When this occurs, \(d_{max}\) gets pushed closer to the surface and the surface dose increases.</p>
<p>For example, consider an 18MeV beam. Its practical range is about 9cm. A 5x5 field size is smaller and so would result in shallower \(d_{max}\) and increased skin dose. Field sizes 9x9 and larger would look practically identical to one another.</p>
