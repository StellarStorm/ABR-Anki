## Question
<h2>What does a bow-tie filter do?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>A bow-tie filter minimizes the dynamic range of exposures at the detector. It does this by attenuating less at the center of the filter, and correspondingly more towards the edges. For patients, this also helps reduce scatter and dose.</p>
