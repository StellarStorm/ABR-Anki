## Question
<h2>Describe the 3 types of photon coincidence for PET</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>True coincidence: the signals are coming from two photons originating from the same annihilation event</li>
<li>Scatter coincidence: the signals come from two photons originating from the same annihilation event, but at least one has been scattered so that the reconstructed line-of-response is in the incorrect location</li>
<li>Random coincidence: the signals come from unrelated photons that just happen to reach the detector within the coincidence time window and around 180 degrees apart.</li>
</ol>
