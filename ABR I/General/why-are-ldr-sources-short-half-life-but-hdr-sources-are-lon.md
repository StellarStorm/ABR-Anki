## Question
<h2>Why are LDR sources short half-life, but HDR sources are long half-life?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>For LDR, the implant will be left in permanently so we want dose to be delivered quickly, and to be able to release the patient to everyday life. A short half-life means the decay will proceed relatively quickly.</p>
<p>For HDR, the source stays in the clinic, where it’s economically advantageous to have a source that doesn’t have to be replaced often. Therefore, a longer half-life is better.</p>
