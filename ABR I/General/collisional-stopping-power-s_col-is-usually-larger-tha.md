## Question
<h2>Collisional stopping power \(S_{col}\) is usually larger than radiative stopping power \(S_{rad}\), except for which case? Why is this important for medical physics?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>\(S_{rad}\) can be larger than \(S_{col}\) for high energy electrons in a high-Z material. This is important for situations like the tungsten target of a linac, where the larger \(S_{rad}\) leads to primarily Brem. production.</p>
