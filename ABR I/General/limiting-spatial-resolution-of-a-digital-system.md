## Question
<h2>Limiting spatial resolution of a digital system.</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>The limiting spatial resolution is half the sampling frequency (e.g. the Nyquist frequency).</p>
<p>For example, a sampling frequency of 10 per mm has a limiting resolution of 5 line pairs per mm.
- 1 mm containing 10 pixels can display 5 pairs of black and white pixels.</p>
