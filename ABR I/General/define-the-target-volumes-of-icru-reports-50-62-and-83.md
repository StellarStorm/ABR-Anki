## Question
<h2>Define the target volumes of ICRU Reports 50, 62, and 83</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>Gross Tumor Volume: Can be palpated or visualized radiographically</li>
<li>Clinical Target Volume: Expansion to account for the extension of occult disease that is not observable on imaging</li>
<li>Internal Target Volume: Expansion to account for physiological motion of the target</li>
<li>Planning Target Volume: Expansion to account for variability in patient setup</li>
<li>Treated Volume: Volume enclosed by some isodose surface defined by the RO as necessary to achieve the purpose of treatment</li>
<li>Irradiated Volume: Volume irradiated to a “significant dose” relative to normal tissue tolerance, typically taken to be the 50% isodose line</li>
</ol>
