## Question
<h2>Since (energy) conversion efficiency of common screens are 10%, does that mean we get fewer light photons emitted than x-ray photons absorbed?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>No - the opposite is true! 10% conversion efficiency means that, for instance, a 10keV x-ray photon will trigger the release of 1keV of light energy. But since light photons are about 2eV, that single x-ray photon can produce 500 light photons.</p>
