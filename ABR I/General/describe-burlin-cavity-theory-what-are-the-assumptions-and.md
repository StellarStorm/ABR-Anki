## Question
<h2>Describe Burlin cavity theory. What are the assumptions and the formula? Does it assume the cavity is large or small?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Burlin cavity theory generalizes cavity theory for both small and large cavities. It assumes
1. CPE or TCPE are present
(and that’s it!)</p>
<p>\(\frac{D_{\text{med}}}{D_{\text{gas}}} = d(\frac{\bar{L}}{\rho})^{\text{med}}_{\text{gas}} + (1 - d)(\frac{\mu_{\text{en}}}{\rho})^{\text{med}}_{\text{gas}}\) </p><ul><li>d is a parameter for the cavity size</li><ul><li>0 for large cavities</li><li>1 for small cavities</li></ul></ul>
<p>Burlin cavity theory makes no assumptions about cavity size. Instead, it’s an explicit parameter.</p>
