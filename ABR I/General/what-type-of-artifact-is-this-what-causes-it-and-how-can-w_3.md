## Question
<h2>What type of artifact is this? What causes it, and how can we address it?</h2><div><img alt="" src="53802038-BDC8-4CE7-860C-05EF439F1FBE.png"> <img alt="" src="34BAA647-2FD3-4F09-A0A8-9D233361A757.png">

## Answer
<section>
<p>This is metal artifact caused by photon starvation, beam hardening, and/or partial volume effects. We can help reduce it with higher kVp beam, dual-energy imaging, and metal artifact reduction (MAR) reconstruction techniques.
