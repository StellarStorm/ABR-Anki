## Question
<h2>How does tube current modulation work? What is its purpose?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Tube current modulation works by varying the mA during each rotation based upon expected attenuation. This helps maintain image quality/noise at the same level across patient anatomy. </p>

For smaller patients, this can result in radiation dose decrease.
For larger patients, this can result in radiation dose increase.</p>
