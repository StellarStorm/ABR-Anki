## Front
Describe how electrons are gaining energy in the "buncher" and in the subsequent cavities of the accelerating waveguide.

## Back
In the buncher (the first section of the waveguide), electrons are being accelerated from near rest. Therefore most energy gain comes from increase in velocity.

In the cavities beyond the buncher, most electrons are travelling near the speed of light. Here, most energy gain comes from increase in relativistic mass.
