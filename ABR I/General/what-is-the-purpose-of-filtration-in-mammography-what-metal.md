## Question
<h2>What is the purpose of filtration in mammography? What metals are commonly used (3)?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>We want to remove both high- and low-energy photons.
- High-energy (from Bremsstrahlung) because we need lower-energy photons in mammography to get acceptable contrast between tumor and normal glandular tissue
- Low-energy for the same reason as all radiography: remove photons that only contribute dose and donâ€™t improve imaging</p>
<p>Mo, Rh, and Ag are common filters.</p>
