## Question
<h2>Describe techniques to manage respiratory motion (4).</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>Set up larger margins to ensure the tumor coverage will be adequate during treatment. An iGTV (internal GTV) can be setup that includes all tumor motion during the breathing phases of the 4DCT or MIP.</li>
<li>Respiratory gating, where breathing is monitored during treatment and the linac is only turned on during some predefined window of the respiratory signal.</li>
<li>Breath-hold treatment. Can be “active” where a spirometer controls the patient’s breathing (sounds rather uncomfortable).</li>
<li>Compression of the abdomen to limit tumor motion</li>
</ol>
