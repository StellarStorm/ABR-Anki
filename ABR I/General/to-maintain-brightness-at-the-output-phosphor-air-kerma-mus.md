## Question
<h2>To maintain brightness at the output phosphor, air kerma must be ??? if the field size is reduced.</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>To maintain brightness, air kerma must be <u>â€‹increased</u> if field size is reduced.</p>
<p>Consider how the units for conversion factor (which measures light output) is \(\frac{cd/m^2}{\mu Gy /s} \longrightarrow \frac{cd \cdot s}{\mu Gy \cdot m^2}\). So if area \(m^2\) decreases, air kerma \(\mu Gy\) must be increased to maintain brightness.</p>
