## Question
<h2>What is effective dose?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Effective dose takes the different responses of different tissues to radiation into account. It’s found by multiplying equivalent dose to an organ by that organs’ weighting factor, and summing up for all irradiated organs.</p>
<p>\(E = \sum{H w_T} = \sum{w_T \sum{D w_R}}\)</p>
