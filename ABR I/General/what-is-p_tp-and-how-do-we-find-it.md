## Question
<h2>What is \(P_{TP}\) and how do we find it?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>\(P_{TP}\) is the temperature-pressure correction factor for the ion chamber to make the reading equivalent to that done in the standard conditions of the calibrating laboratory.</p>
<p>We find this by measuring </p><p></p><ol><li>The temperature of the water in the tank, in Celsius </li><li>The air pressure, in kPa</li><li>Solving
\(P_{TP} = \frac{273.2 + T}{273.2 + 22.0}\times \frac{101.33}{P}\)</li></ol><p></p>
