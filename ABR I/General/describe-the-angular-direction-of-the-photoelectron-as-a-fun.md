## Question
<h2>Describe the angular direction of the photoelectron as a function of the photon energy. Why?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>At low energies, the photoelectron will be ejected about \(90\degree\) relative to the incident photon</p><p></p><ul><li>Photon is an EM wave. The induced motion of the photoelectron is in the <u>â€‹transverse</u> direction of the electric field.</li></ul><p></p>
<p>At higher energies, the photoelectron becomes more forward peaked.</p><p></p><ul><li>This is because it conserves the momentum of the photon.</li></ul><p></p>
