## Question
<h2>Explain what \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are in the linear quadratic model</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>\(\alpha\) is the average probability per unit dose that a lethal double strand break will occur
\(\beta\) is the average probability per unit (dose)^2 that a lethal double strand break will occur</p>
<p>Recall that in the linear quadratic model, the surviving fraction is \(S = e^{-\alpha D - \beta D^2}\)</p>
