## Question
<h2>Define the effective energy of an x-ray spectrum. What is the approximate relation to peak energy for an unfiltered beam?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>The effective energy of an x-ray spectrum is the energy of the monoenergetic beam of photons that has the same penetrating ability (HVL) as the x-ray spectrum. For an unfiltered beam, itâ€™s generally close to 30-40% of the peak energy.</p>
