## Question
<h2>Describe the physics of the proton/heavy ion Bragg peak.</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>From the Bethe-Bloch formula, we know that energy loss \(-\frac{dE}{dx} \propto \frac{1}{v^2}\)</p>
<p>Therefore and especially since the <strong>square</strong>  of velocity is inversely proportional to energy loss, as the proton slows down to near 0, the energy loss shoots up.</p>
