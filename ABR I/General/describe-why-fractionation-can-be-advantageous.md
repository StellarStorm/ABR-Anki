## Question
<h2>Describe why fractionation can be advantageous.</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Normal tissues tend to be late-responding and have better sublethal damage repair than tumor, which tends to be early responding. Therefore, fractionation gives normal tissues time to repair between treatments, while the tumor cannot recover as well and therefore the surviving fraction grows smaller. </p>
