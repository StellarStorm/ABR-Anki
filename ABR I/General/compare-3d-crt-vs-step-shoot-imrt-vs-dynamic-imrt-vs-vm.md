## Question
<h2>Compare 3D CRT vs. Step & Shoot IMRT vs. Dynamic IMRT vs. VMAT</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>3D CRT treats with multiple (e.g. 2 or 4) fixed gantry angles. MLCs are used to shape beam but do not move for a given beam.</p>
<p>Step & Shoot IMRT treats with multiple (e.g. 6 or 9) fixed gantry angles. MLCs are used to shape beam. For a given beam, the MLCs are moved to generate a particular field, the beam is turned on for some time and then back off, and the MLCs move to form the next field, beam on/off, and so on. The final fluence map is essentially the sum of the individual fluence patterns. (Then the gantry will move to the next beam).</p>
<p>Dynamic (sliding window) IMRT also treats with multiple fixed gantry angles. Here, the MLCs will move during beam-on to generate the fluence map. As before, the gantry does not move during beam-on.</p>
<p>VMAT is essentially dynamic IMRT with gantry motion during beam-on. Both the MLCs and the gantry will be moving during beam-on.</p>
