## Question
<h2>Describe why the dose distributions are different in the left image vs. the right.</h2><div><img src="paste-73dcdf324177c20cbbd96bd36debbd880432038e.png">
</div>

## Answer
<section>
<p>This is an example of dose being calculated with tissue inhomogeneities accounted for (left) vs. dose being calculated in a homogenous medium, e.g., water (right). The left image with inhomogeneity calculations is a better representation of how dose will be distributed in the body.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Attenuation of the beam will be much less due to the lower density of the lung</li>
<li>Dose distribution shape will be different due to that attenuation and scattering differences</li>
<li>Penumbra is wider in the presence of the inhomogeneity due to the longer range of the electrons, and this increases with increasing beam energy because the electron range will increase.</li></ul>
