## Question
<h2>For a parallel-opposed 2-beam treatment, describe how superficial hotspots are affected as a function of patient thickness.</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Superficial hotspots are higher as patient thickness or separation (e.g., lateral instead of AP/PA) increases. This follows as more dose will be delivered superficially in order to get prescribed dose to the target.</p>
<p>This effect is greatly dependent on the number of beams used - more beams means lower superficial hotspots. (At its extreme, this is why VMAT works so well.)</p>
