## Question
<h2>Compare direct and indirect action. Which is the most common cause of biological damage?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Direct action occurs when the electrons directly ionize a target molecule.
Indirect action occurs when the electrons interact with water to produce a hydroxyl radical, which then diffuses and damages target molecules.</p>
<p>Indirectly action accounts for about 2/3 of biological damage.</p>
