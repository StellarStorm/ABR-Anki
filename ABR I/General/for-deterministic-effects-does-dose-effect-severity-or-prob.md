## Question
<h2>For deterministic effects, does dose effect severity or probability?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Dose affects severity of deterministic effects.</p>
<p>(Recall that deterministic effects are “binary” and have a threshold. Dose should impact the severity, but not probability - either there is enough dose to trigger the effect or there isn’t.)</p>
