## Question
<h2>Describe the basics of the Manchester system.</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>In the Manchester system for brachy, there is about 1cm of spacing between line sources. Peripheral loading is used - that is, higher activity sources are loaded near the periphery than are loaded at the center, so that the overall dose is about the same everywhere (since more sources will contribute to the center than to the peripheries).</p>
