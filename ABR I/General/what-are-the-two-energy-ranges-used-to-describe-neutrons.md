## Question
<h2>What are the two energy ranges used to describe neutrons?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>How does each one interact with matter?</p>
<ul>
<li><u>​Thermal</u> neutrons have energy \<0.025eV. They are usually captured by H or N.</li>
<li><u>​Fast</u> neutrons have energy >100eV. They have elastic collisions and deposit dose through the interactions of charge particles</li>
</ul>
