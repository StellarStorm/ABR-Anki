## Question
<h2>What is the legal minimum HVL of an 80 kV beam in many states? Why?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>The minimum HVL is 2.5mm Al (typical beams are 3mm HVL). If the beam quality were below this, it would mean there are too many low-energy photons in the beam that are contributing dose without improving the image.</p>
