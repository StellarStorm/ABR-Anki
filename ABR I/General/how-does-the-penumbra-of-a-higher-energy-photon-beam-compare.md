## Question
<h2>How does the penumbra of a higher-energy photon beam compare to that of a lower-energy photon beam? Why?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Higher-energy photon beams have larger penumbra than lower-energy photon beams. This is because of electron scattering near the field edge. Since electron range in tissue increases with photon beam energy (\(\text{range}\approx \frac{MV}{2}\)), there’s more “smearing” near the field edge and a larger penumbra.</p>
