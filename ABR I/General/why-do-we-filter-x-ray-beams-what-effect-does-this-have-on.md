## Question
<h2>Why do we filter x-ray beams? What effect does this have on the beam?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Low-energy photons are unlikely to make it through the patient and just give unnecessary dose, so we want to filter them out.</p>
<p>Filtration naturally decreases tube output, but has no effect on the maximum energy of the x-ray beam spectrum. Average energy will be increased (“beam hardening”).</p>
