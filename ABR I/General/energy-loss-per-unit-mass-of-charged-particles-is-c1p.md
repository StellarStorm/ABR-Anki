## Text
Energy loss per unit mass of charged particles is {{c1::\(\propto \frac{C^2}{v^2}\)
<ul><li><i>C</i> is the charge - greater charge, greater interaction for same velocity</li><li><i>v</i> is the velocity - greater speed, less time to interact & less energy transferred</li><ul><li>At high velocities, charged particles are losing energy primarily from their relativistic mass, not velocity. </li><li>At low velocities, most energy is given up near the end of the path - this gives the Bragg peak!</li></ul></ul>}}
