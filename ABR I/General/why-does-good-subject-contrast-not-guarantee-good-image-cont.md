## Question
<h2>Why does good subject contrast not guarantee good image contrast?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Subject contrast directly relates to x-ray attenuation in the body, while image contrast is the difference in film density. If a film is underexposed, we might have great subject contrast but poor image contrast (e.g. the film is all white)</p>
