## Question
<h2>What model is used for determining radiation risks? Where does it come from & what is a limitation?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>The LNT (linear no-threshold) model is used, and originates from the BEIR VIII (2006) report.</p>
<p>A major limitation is that the information comes from atomic bombing survivors, where we have data from \(\sim 100mSv\) and higher, but not much for lower effective doses. Therefore we donâ€™t necessarily know the effects of low levels of radiation.</p>
