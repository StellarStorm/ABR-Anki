## Question
<h2>Why is the effective point of measurement upstream the physical point of measurement for cylindrical chambers?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>For an ion chamber, the physical point of measurement is on the central axis of the chamber (e.g. along the central electrode). However, the electrons measured there will largely have been created upstream, due to the electrons having been scattered forward.</p>
