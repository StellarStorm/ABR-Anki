## Question
<h2>Are SBRT plans homogenous within the target region (relative to standard fractionation plans)?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>No (surprisingly)!
The goal of SBRT is to allow for a steep dose gradient at the periphery of the tumor. Dose is often prescribed to a relatively low isodose line (70%, for example).
This means that within the PTV, there may be significant heterogeneity.</p>
