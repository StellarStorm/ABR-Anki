## Question
<h2>Define phantom scatter factor \(S_p\) used in MU calculations. Can it be directly measured?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>\(S_p\) accounts for the change in scatter radiation originating in the phantom at a reference depth as the field size is changed. It’s essentially the ratio of dose rate at some given field to dose rate at the same point and depth for the reference field (e.g., \(10 \times 10\)cm). </p>
<p>It can’t be directly measured (per Dr. Melacon), but it can be determined as \(S_p = \frac{S_{c,p}}{S_c}\)</p>
