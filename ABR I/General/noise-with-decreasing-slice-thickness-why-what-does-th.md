## Question
<h2>Noise ??? with decreasing slice thickness. Why? What does this imply for dose required to achieve the same noise level?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Image noise <u>â€‹increases</u> with decreasing slice thickness. This is because \(\text{Noise} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{\text{photons}}}}\), and thinner slices will have fewer photons and therefore more noise.
This of course implies that we would have to give more photons, and therefore more dose, to get the same noise level if thinner slices are to be used. </p>
