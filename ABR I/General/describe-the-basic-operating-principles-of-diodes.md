## Question
<h2>Describe the basic operating principles of diodes</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>A p-type (positive) and an n-type (negative) crystal are placed in contact</li>
<li>An excess of electrons develops on the p-side, and an excess of holes on the n-side</li>
<li>In the middle is the <em>depletion zone</em> with 0 charge</li>
<li>There is a 1-V across the depletion region, and a high electric field due to the very thin region</li>
<li>Electrons entering the device get accelerated across the electric field to the n-side</li>
<li>This can be read out as a charge</li>
</ol>
