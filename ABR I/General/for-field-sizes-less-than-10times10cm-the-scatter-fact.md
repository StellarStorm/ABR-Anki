## Question
<h2>For field sizes less than \(10\times10\)cm, the scatter factors \(S_c\) and \(S_p\) are ???</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>For field sizes less than \(10\times10\)cm, the scatter factors \(S_c\) and \(S_p\) are <strong>less than one</strong>.</p>
<p>Interpretation: MU count will be higher than dose, all other factors 1
\[MU = \frac{D}{… S_c S_p …}\]</p>
