## Question
<h2>What beam properties do PDD depend on? Why? (2)</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>PDD falls off more slowly for higher beam energies for two reasons. First, the depth of \(d_{max}\) is deeper for higher energies, second, attenuation is somewhat less for higher energies.</li>
<li>PDD falls off more slowly for larger field sizes, due to more scatter toward the center of the beam (because there’s a larger region for scatter to originate from). This doesn’t contribute as much as beam energy though.</li>
</ol>
