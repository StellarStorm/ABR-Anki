## Question
<h2>Describe the components of the linac head in photon mode from source to patient.</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>Target: tungsten</li>
<li>Primary collimator: conical in shape, restricts beam to a circular region</li>
<li>Flattening filter (usually): to make beam profile more uniform instead of more intensity in center</li>
<li>Monitor chamber: ion chambers to monitor dose of beam passing through. Chamber 1 shuts off the beam after enough MUs during treatment, and chamber 2 serves as a backup.</li>
<li>Mirror assembly system: thin mylar window at 45 degrees to beam with light source to reflect off and down.</li>
<li>Jaws: thick metal collimators to provide blocking</li>
<li>MLCs: numerous metal blades to provide field shaping.</li>
</ol>
