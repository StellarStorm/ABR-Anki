## Question
<h2>What does beam profile flatness depend on? (2)</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<ol>
<li>Beam profile flatness is strongly dependent upon depth. At greater depth, the beam is more flat than at shallow depths. This is because photons and electrons are more likely to be scattered towards the center of the beam (compared to shallow depths, where thereâ€™s not much build-up).</li>
<li>Beam profile flatness is also inversely related to energy: higher-MV beams are less flat especially at shallower depths.</li>
