## Question
<h2>What phenomena rely on electron density?</h2><div>How does electron density relate to Z?
</div>

## Answer
<section>
<ul><li>Compton scatter of photons is directly proportional to electron density.</li>
<li>Collisional stopping power \(S_{col}\) of electrons is directly proportional to electron density.</li>
</ul>
<p>For most elements in the human body, the number of electrons increases roughly the same as the number of protons and neutrons, so electron density would be roughly constant. There are two exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hydrogen is just a single proton and no neutron, so hydrogen-dense materials have greater electron density.</li><ol><li>This implies that hydrogen will undergo about double the Compton interactions per unit mass than any other low-mass element.</li></ol>
<li>High-Z elements require increasingly more neutrons to hold the nucleus together, so they have lower electron density.</li>
</ol>
