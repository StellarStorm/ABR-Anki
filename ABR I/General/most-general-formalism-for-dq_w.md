## Question
<h2><u>â€‹Most</u> general formalism for \(D^Q_w\)</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>Under <strong>reference conditions</strong>
\(D^Q_w = M N^Q_{D,w}\) [Gy]</p>
<p>where </p><p>\(D^Q_w\) is the absorbed dose to water (in Gy) at the point of measurement of the ion chamber when it is absent</p><p>\(M\) is the fully corrected electrometer reading in coulombs (C) or meter units (rdg)</p><p>\(N^Q_{D,w}\) is the absorbed dose to water calibration factor for an ion chamber located in a beam of quality \(Q\)</p>
