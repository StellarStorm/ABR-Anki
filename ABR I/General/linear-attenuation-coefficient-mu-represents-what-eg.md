## Question
<h2>Linear attenuation coefficient \(\mu\) represents what? (E.g., \(\mu=0.1 cm^{-1}\) means what?)</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>\(\mu\) represents the fraction of incident photons <u>â€‹removed</u> from the beam in traveling a unit distance. In the example \(\mu=0.1 cm^{-1}\), this means 10% of photons are attenuated in 1cm of material (or 90% still remaining).</p>
