## Question
<h2>Why does GE depend strongly upon T2* instead of the (almost) T2 for SE?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>SE can largely cancel out effects of the magnetic field variations due to the 180-degree refocusing RF pulse.</p>
<p>However, GE dephasing and rephasing occurs in the same plane. Therefore, inhomogeneities in the magnetic field are emphasized rather than cancelled, since \(M_{xy}\) is a strong function of T2*.</p>
<p>Recall that T2 is the “true” dephasing time in a perfect field. T2* is much shorter and includes effects of the magnetic field inhomogeneities. </p>
