## Question
<h2>What is the energy of an Auger electron?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>
The energy of the Auger electron is just the difference between the energy released by the nucleus or falling-in electron and the binding energy of the ejected electron.
\[E_{e^-_{\text{Auger}}} = h\nu - E_b\]
</p><p><i>Recall there are a few ways the energy that ejects an Auger electron could be produced:</i>
</p><ol><li><i>The energy released by an outer-shell electron falling into an inner-shell hole, e.g. following the photoelectric effect.</i></li><li><i>Internal conversion, where the energy released from the metastable nucleus is absorbed by an electron.</i></li></ol>
