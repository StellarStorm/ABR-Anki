## Question
<h2>What is the approximate depth of \(R_{50}\)? Is this the value that should actually be used?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>\(R_{50} \approx E/2.33\)</p>
<p>Donâ€™t actually use this value for calculations - this is just a decent area to place the ion chamber in the search for \(I_{50}\).</p>
