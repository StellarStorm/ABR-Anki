## Question
<h2>What does MTF describe? What is its minimum useful value and range?</h2>

## Answer
<section>
<p>MTF describes how well a detector can “transfer” contrast at a particular spatial resolution. Low MTF means that spatial frequencies at that level are hard to observe (e.g., low contrast). We can generally resolve objects with an MTF of 0.1, and the range is 0 (complete contrast loss) to 1 (no contrast loss).</p>
